# FIT1056-Sem2-2025-new
This is the new repository of Dawn_Bui, due to bad setups from the previous one

1. For PST1:
- This has been completed and all files are in the old repository (FIT1056-Sem2-2025-new)
2. For PST2 (and onwards):
(Every details for later PST and PST2 will be updated in this file)
- This update consist of a persistent memory system via a JSON file.
- The first part implements basic interaction functions needed to perform the act of loading and saving using the memory
- The second part implements more complex functions (CRUD) to create, retrieve, update and delete datas of students and teachers saved in the system
- The third part is a major update, namely allowing the student to check-in and print their ID cards.
- And the last part was where the main reception/interface part of the MSMS system, updated to match with the new persistent memory system. 
- How to run and test: Run it, add some data in and try all of the functions
- Design: Nothing intentional, but I would like the system to at least be polite, because even if this is just codes and not a human receptionist, it's still customer service: You can't poke the nerves of your customers and expect them to like it. Also, I made some of the input variables for the main function short, because I don't feel the need to elaborate on them too much. They are just needed to feed the input into the important functions.
